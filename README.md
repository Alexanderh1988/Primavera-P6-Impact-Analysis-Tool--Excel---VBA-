**Primavera P6 Impact Analysis Tool (Excel + VBA)**

A lightweight VBA-based tool to perform impact analysis on Oracle Primavera P6 schedules using Activity IDs. This solution is designed for planners, schedulers, and project managers who need to quickly assess the upstream and downstream effects of changes (e.g., delays, scope modifications) to a specific activityâ€”without requiring direct database access or P6 SDK.

When an activity in a Primavera P6 schedule is modified (e.g., delayed or resourced differently), it can ripple through the project network. This tool helps you:

Identify direct predecessors (upstream dependencies)
Identify direct successors (downstream dependencies)
Visualize impacted activities in a clear Excel report
Make informed decisions before implementing changes in P6

The tool generates a summary sheet (Impact_Analysis) with:

Activity ID and name
Duration, Start, and Finish dates
Impact type:
Target Activity
Upstream (Predecessor)
Downstream (Successor)
